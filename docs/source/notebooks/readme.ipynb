    "    version (version v1 and v2 on arxiv). We strongly recommend using this\n",
    "    architecture as it performs much better and has nicer properties than\n",
    "    our earlier version. For example:\n",

    "        temporal convolution. The use of the depth_multiplier option maps \n",
    "        exactly to the number of spatial filters learned within a temporal\n",
    "        filter. This matches the setup of algorithms like FBCSP which learn \n",
    "        spatial filters within each filter in a filter-bank. This also limits \n",
    "        the number of free parameters to fit when compared to a fully-connected\n",
    "        convolution. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. Separable Convolutions to learn how to optimally combine spatial\n",
    "        filters across temporal bands. Separable Convolutions are Depthwise\n",
    "        Convolutions followed by (1x1) Pointwise Convolutions. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "    While the original paper used Dropout, we found that SpatialDropout2D \n",
    "    sometimes produced slightly better results for classification of ERP \n",
    "    signals. However, SpatialDropout2D significantly reduced performance \n",
    "    on the Oscillatory dataset (SMR, BCI-IV Dataset 2A). We recommend using\n",
    "    the default Dropout in most cases.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Assumes the input signal is sampled at 128Hz. If you want to use this model\n",
    "    for any other sampling rate you will need to modify the lengths of temporal\n",
    "    kernels and average pooling size in blocks 1 and 2 as needed (double the \n",
    "    kernel lengths for double the sampling rate, etc). Note that we haven't \n",
    "    tested the model performance with this rule so this may not work well. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The model with default parameters gives the EEGNet-8,2 model as discussed\n",
    "    in the paper. This model should do pretty well in general, although it is\n",

    "    overcomplete). We believe the main parameters to focus on are F1 and D. "
